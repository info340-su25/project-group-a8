        Problem Description:
    </h2>

    <p> Many college students experience not only academic pressure but also the constant demand to optimize every aspect of their lives. Between digital distractions, burnout, and social comparison, students often neglect the offline habits and mindsets that support mental clarity, emotional well-being, and fun. This is especially true at the end of a long day, when students need a space to decompress, recenter, and reconnect with themselves outside the pressures of coursework and academics. However, many wellness resources on campus or online are difficult to find, feel clinical, or focus only on academic productivity, rather than fostering holistic mind-body well-being.</p>
    <p> This creates an information technology gap: students lack a warm, accessible, student-centered platform to actively engage with their own wellness in a low-pressure, interactive way that prioritizes life beyond grades. While tools like <a href="https://www.headspace.com/" target="_blank">Headspace</a> and <a href="https://www.calm.com/" target="_blank">Calm</a> support mindfulness, they often miss the broader emotional and social needs of student life. Unfold aims to address this unmet need by providing a digital wellness garden where students can reflect on their mental, social, and physical well-being, discover accessible offline activities, and decompress meaningfully through playful, student-driven resources and tools. We want students to feel that wellness is possible even in small moments, with a space that centers joy, grounding, and offline living.</p>

    <h2>
        Proposed Application:
    </h2>

    <p>This application would be geared towards college students who feel burned out, emotionally/mentally drained, 
      or just want a place to rewind and have fun. It will include multiple ways in which a user can “unfold”. This 
      application will cultivate the mental and emotional needs of students who are a part of a specific community. 
      We want to gear towards community building and personal growth. Unfold would link the users to their college, 
      allowing the social aspects of Unfold to be within their community. For the personal aspects, Unfold helps 
      users cultivate a life of thanksgiving and one full of memories. 
      In Unfold, users will have multiple access points to unwind:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Thoughtful Quiet Time - This section will allow you to track your week through sleep, habits, and journal 
        thankfulness entries (with prompts) to help be grateful for the good things in the week.
        Possible Features: Tracker/logger, submission entries</li>
      
      <li>Unplug Quests - For this section, users can earn “rewards” based on completed quests. Quests can include:
         Unplug Timer, Chore Completion, and Fresh Air 
        Possible Features: Interactive elements, progress tracker, gamification</li>
      
      <li>Fun Idea Generator - Users would be inspired by offline ideas. This section would include randomly generated 
        ideas that can inspire fun off of the screen. The user can select inside, outside, with friends or alone. Pictures of 
        these activities can also be shared among friends in a social aspect to inspire each other to do similar things 
        Possible Features: Randomization, Tracker, submission entries, media upload</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Features:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Progress Tracker / Logger (full)</li>
      <li>Media Upload / Submission Entries (full)</li>
      <li>Randomization / Interaction (half)</li>
    </ol>
