        Problem Description:
    </h2>

    <p>
      Many college students experience not only academic pressure but also the constant demand to optimize every aspect of their lives. Between digital distractions, burnout, and social comparison, students often neglect the offline habits and mindsets that support mental clarity, emotional well-being, and fun. This is especially true at the end of a long day, when students need a space to decompress, recenter, and reconnect with themselves outside the pressures of coursework and academics. However, many wellness resources on campus or online are difficult to find, feel clinical, or focus only on academic productivity, rather than fostering holistic mind-body well-being.
    </p>
    <p>
      This creates an information technology gap: students lack a warm, accessible, student-centered platform to actively engage with their own wellness in a low-pressure, interactive way that prioritizes life beyond grades. While tools like <a href="https://www.headspace.com/" target="_blank">Headspace</a> and <a href="https://www.calm.com/" target="_blank">Calm</a> support mindfulness, they often miss the broader emotional and social needs of student life. Unfold aims to address this unmet need by providing a digital wellness garden where students can reflect on their mental, social, and physical well-being, discover accessible offline activities, and decompress meaningfully through playful, student-driven resources and tools. We want students to feel that wellness is possible even in small moments, with a space that centers joy, grounding, and offline living.

    <h2>
        Proposed Application:
    </h2>

    <p>
        <!-- insert here!
        Your proposal will also contain a description of the web app that you will create to help address your chosen problem (a proposed "solution"). Think about what kind of a web app would help with this problem, and how people would use that app to make their lives better in some way. What is the "use case" or "user story"Links to an external site. for the app?

        Remember that this app will be interactive—it will need to contain buttons, forms, etc that let the user provide some kind of input and modify how data is presented to them. Thus your app will need to do more than just be something for the user to read; it needs to give the user something to do.
        Your app should also be described in 2-3 paragraphs. In particular, you should make sure to address:

            Who are the users of the application? That is, who will be accessing the website? What impacts might this app have on minority groups?

            What will the users do with the web app? What kind of interactive features are you expecting to provide? Remember that you app will need to include at least "two and a half" significant features; be sure to explicitly identify and explain what all of them are! Remember:

            Remember that "viewing" information or navigating ("going to") to something isn't a feature!
            What kind of information will the users be viewing? If intend to use data from an external source (a csv file or an API), include a link and citation to that data.

            - If you insist on using an API, confirm that you'll be able to access it from a client-side app by testing it at https://joelwross.github.io/cors-test/Links to an external site.. If you can't get data back from this testing site, then it won't work with your project.

            How will using this app help to solve your chosen problem? That is, how is it a solution to the problem you described?

            - Remember the app doesn't need to have "business value". But as Informatics students we care about the practical usage and impacts of systems, not just their implementation. Be sure to consider that in your proposal!
